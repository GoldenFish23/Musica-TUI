# Why Musica?

Musica is born from the understanding that your computer's resources are precious. Whether you are a gamer pushing for every single FPS or a developer running intensive AI models, your music shouldn't be the thing that slows you down.

## Our Philosophy:
- **Everyone loves music, so do we?** We believe music is essential to the human experience, especially during work or play.
- **The Gamer's Choice:** Gamers love to play games smoothly and will delete anything if it's less important to their performance. Musica stays out of the way.
- **The Developer's Companion:** Software development can be resource-intensive, especially with modern AI tools. Musica ensures you can still listen to your favorite music without sacrificing your build times or model training.
- **Beyond the GUI:** Linux needs GUI players... but why? Often, a GUI is just extra overhead.
- **Minimal Graphics, Maximum Experience:** This player uses minimal graphics with a Text User Interface (TUI). This allows you to play music while you utilize the most of your PC or Laptop for what matters most.

Musica is a light-weight, efficient, and beautiful terminal music player built for those who demand performance.
